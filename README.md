## COVID-19-Named-Entity-Recognition-for-Vietnamese

My replication of this [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.03879). About the paperâ€™s main goals:
> - To develop a NER task in the COVID-19 specified domain, that potentially impacts research and downstream applications.
> - To provide the research community with a new dataset for recognizing COVID-19 related named entities in Vietnamese.

The dataset is called PhoNER and publicly released at [here](https://github.com/VinAIResearch/PhoNER_COVID19).
